(Data Cleaning, Analysis, Visualization, Feature Selection, Predictive Modeling)
### Problem Statement
The revenue team of a well-known hotel group recently faced a significant problem â€” an increase in cancellations. This trend not only disrupted the efficient functioning of the hotels but also resulted in substantial revenue losses. The team required insights and solutions: What were the factors driving these cancellations? Were there any identifiable patterns or trends? In order to tackle these crucial inquiries, data analysis emerged as the most powerful tool.

### Task
Our task was clear: to analyze extensive hotel booking data spanning three years, encompassing the years 2018, 2019, and 2020. By meticulously examining this data, we aimed to uncover the underlying causes of hotel cancellations and gain a deeper understanding of the cancellation landscape. Our journey began with data preprocessing, cleaning, and consolidation, to ensure that the dataset was ready for analysis. This included addressing missing values and integrating data from different sources to create a comprehensive dataset.
